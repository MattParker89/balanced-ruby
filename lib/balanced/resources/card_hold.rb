  # A Hold is a reservation of funds on a funding source such as a Card. This
  # reservation is guaranteed until the +expires_at+ date. You may capture
  # the Hold at any time before then which will create a Debit and transfer
  # the funds to your Marketplace. If you do not capture the Hold it will
  # be marked as invalid which is represented by the +is_void+ field being
  # set to +true+.
  #
  # By default a Hold is created using the most recently added funding source
  # on the Account. You may specify a specific funding source such as a Card
  # or BankAccount uri.
